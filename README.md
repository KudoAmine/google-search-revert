# Description

CSS to partially revert Google's mobile design that went wide on desktop 1/16/20.

# Instructions

Use one of the many Chrome extensions that allow persistent CSS tweaks for third party websites. (Stylus, Stylebot, Stylish, etc)

**Note:** These changes may break at any time when Google pushes a style update. If you don't limit these tweaks to the Google results page only they may unpredictably affect other Google pages.
